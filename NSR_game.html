          <h2>Noble, Steed & Rabble</h2>
          <p>This game was created in the Victoria University competition 'PxlJam'. In a team of three, we were provided with the theme "With your powers combined" which had to be incorporated in the game somehow. We decided to make a four player game where the players combine their powers to control both horse and knight to de-horse their competiton in a jousting tournament.</p>
